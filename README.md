Predictive Machine Learning Approach for Grain Yield and Other Agronomic Traits of International Maize Trials in Nigeria.
The project topic is "Predictive Machine Learning Approach for Grain Yield and Other Agronomic Traits of International Maize Trials in Nigeria." Maize (Zea mays L.), a crucial staple food crop, is a significant African continent and global source of raw materials for livestock and several agro-related enterprises (Bello et al., 2010; Randjelovic et al., 2011). Nigeria's savanna agro-ecology offers a large potential for food production due to its high levels of solar radiation, which promote the development of maize.
